## quiz


In this project we're using Coordinators + MVVM and also:
- Alamofire (for our network's manager)
- IQKeyboardManagerSwift (for handle the keyboard)
- SVProgressHUD (our custom loading)

The test's coverage is 60% and in the future I'm gonna update.

To install the dependencies:
```
pod install
```
